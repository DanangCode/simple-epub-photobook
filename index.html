    <p>A new style of street fashion has popped up in the San Francisco Bay Area. The voluptuous female body is being adored in broad daylight in San Francisco. Different ideas from Queer Femme, Fat Activism, Straight/Bi, Sex-Positive culture, The Burning Man Fashion Laboratory, and the Kinky BBW (Big Beautiful Woman) scene. Perhaps, this is a new Gynephilia (the love of woman): Lesbians, Freaks, Transvestites and Kinksters united under the Gynephilic banner of "We love Woman."</p>
 <img alt="Sexy Superhero Streetfashion" src="SexySuperhero-3.jpg"/>
<p>The style depicted here is founded on a love of the Hips, Belly and Thighs. Some themes that i see are:<ul>
     <li>They bring attention to the Belly and Hips. You cannot  hide these things. Hiding behind belts looks weird in the way that botched plastic surgery looks weird.</li>
     <li>They do not rupture curves. They wear their belts high up like a corset.</li>
     <li>Corsets love curvy bodies.</li>
     <li>These women are sexy because they say &quot;I am sexy!&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

  <p>I took all of these photos at the Superhero Street Fair in 2010. This project lasted about six hours. My goal was to find beautiful women that were size 8 and up. I wanted real world sex-positive fashion which shows off voluptuous hips bellies and thighs. San Francisco Burning Man fashion celebrates real world bodies. Body-positivity has become part of the San Francisco Streetlife. I am thrilled to be able to document this read-write fashion rebellion against Centralized Read-Only Fashion in which we are all invisible.</p>

 <p>I found them all so beautiful and irresistible. Every one of them was a sweetheart. I hope these images can inspire more body love rebellion.

   <p>Curvy thighs are so erotic. This Star Trek outfit brings all of your attention to the thigh, while exactly controlling the amount of skin showing. It creates a contradiction and tension.</p>

    <p>A principle of Gynephylic (woman-loving) Fashion is that all bodies are sexy even when they are older than twenty five years old.</p>

    <p>A breathtakingly short skirt. I am not sure why but voluptuous thighs like these seem scandalously sexy.</p>
